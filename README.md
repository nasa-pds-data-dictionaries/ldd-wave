# Wave local data dictionary

The Wave dictionary contains classes that describe the composition of multidimensional
wave data consisting of Array (and Array subclass) data objects.

## Versions

- [1.0.0.0](src/1.0.0.0)

## Builds

A Local Data Dictionary (LDD) is built for each version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/).
The build process insures compatiblity of the LDD with the core information model.

This LDD has been built for the following versions of the PDS4 information model.

- [1.4.0.0](build/1.4.0.0)
	- Package: [v1.4.0.0](https://github.com/nasa-pds/ldd-wave/releases/tag/v1.4.0.0)
	
## Notes

Each build is generating using the [lddtool](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/software/ldd/) specific to a version of the [PDS4 Information Model](https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/doc/im/).

Documentation included in the source (src) directory is generated using the "pds-ldd-doc" tool in the [pds4-tools](https://github.com/nasa-pds/pds4-tools) package.

After a build the README.md files are updated (manually) to reflect the content of repository.
